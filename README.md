# BaremetalBlinky
This repository documents my efforts in building embedded firmware experience by
starting with the hello world of microcontrollers: Blinking an LED.
In my case, I will be doing this solely with the use of datasheets, a gcc compiler, cpq(author of the baremetal programming guide repo) and a few other tools. The goal is to do this with as little abstraction as i can manage
This will be implemented with the NUCLEO STM32F411RE.
